    "Therapeutic Touch (TT) is an energy therapy that practitioners claim can promote health and relaxation. Practitioners place their hands near a patient and say they are able to detect and manipulate the patient's so-called Human Energy Field (HEF). \n",

    "In 1996, Emily Rosa was a 9 year old who had wide exposure to the world of TT due to her parents, who were both medical practitioners and skeptics of the idea of TT. For her 4th grade science fair project, Emily decided to test whether or not TT practitioners could truly interact with a person's HEF. \n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's experiment was clean, simple, and effective. Due to her parents' occupations in the medical field, she had easy access to TT practitioners. With each practitioner, she performed the following experiment several times over several days.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, she would separate herself from the practitioner with a board, so they couldn't see each other.\n",
    "1. Then she'd ask them to place both of their hands through an opening in the board. \n",
    "1. Emily would flip a fair coin to randomly determine whether to place her hands near the practitioner's left hand or right hand. \n",
    "1. Finally, Emily would ask the TT practitioner to specify whether they could detect Emily's Human Energy Field (HEF) near their left hand or their right hand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, Emily performed 280 experiments, and the practitioner picked the correct hand 123 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Emily's main goal here was to test whether or not the TT practitioners' guesses were random, like the flip of a coin. In most medical experiments, this is the norm. We want to test whether or not some treatment has an effect. This is *not* the same as testing whether the treatment actually works as intended. \n",
